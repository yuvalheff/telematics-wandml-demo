# Experiment 1: RF_Baseline_Collision_Prediction

## Executive Summary

This experiment established a baseline Random Forest model for vehicle collision prediction using telematic data. The model achieved a **macro PR-AUC of 0.383**, providing a foundation for collision risk assessment while highlighting significant challenges in this highly imbalanced classification task.

## Experiment Configuration

**Objective**: Develop a predictive model to identify potential car collisions using telematic vehicle data  
**Target Variable**: collisions (multi-class: 0, 1, 2+ collisions)  
**Primary Metric**: PR-AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under Curve) - Macro-averaged  
**Algorithm**: Random Forest with balanced class weighting  

## Key Results

### Performance Metrics
- **Primary Metric**: Macro PR-AUC = 0.383
- **Model Type**: Random Forest with 200 estimators
- **Class Imbalance Strategy**: Balanced class weights
- **Feature Engineering**: Extensive normalization and risk behavior ratios

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Preprocessing**: Missing value imputation, log transformation, standardization
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created exposure-normalized features, risk ratios, and composite risk scores
3. **Feature Selection**: Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation
4. **Model Selection**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning

## Experimental Insights

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Feature Engineering**: Successfully created meaningful derived features including risk behavior ratios and exposure-normalized metrics
- **Robust Evaluation Framework**: Implemented proper cross-validation, multiple evaluation metrics, and extensive visualization
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Applied balanced class weights to address severe imbalance in collision data
- **Model Interpretability**: Random Forest provides clear feature importance rankings for business insights

### Key Limitations
- **Moderate Performance**: 0.383 macro PR-AUC indicates limited discriminative power, particularly challenging for rare collision events
- **Class Imbalance Challenges**: Severe imbalance between no-collision (majority) and collision classes remains problematic
- **Limited Algorithm Exploration**: Focused primarily on Random Forest without extensive comparison to other approaches
- **Feature Space Constraints**: May be missing critical behavioral or contextual features that better predict collision risk

### Technical Execution Issues
- **MLflow Integration**: Encountered serialization and path issues during model logging (resolved in final execution)
- **Manifest Generation**: Initial JSON serialization errors with complex data types

## Business Impact Assessment

### Collision Prediction Capabilities
- **Baseline Established**: Provides initial benchmark for collision risk assessment
- **Feature Insights**: Identified key driving behaviors correlating with collision risk
- **Operational Readiness**: Model artifacts and evaluation framework ready for deployment testing

### Risk Assessment Limitations
- **Low Precision Risk**: 0.383 macro PR-AUC suggests high false positive rates for collision prediction
- **Safety-Critical Concerns**: Performance may be insufficient for high-stakes collision prevention systems
- **Threshold Optimization Needed**: Requires careful calibration for practical deployment

## Future Improvement Opportunities

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Advanced Algorithms**: Experiment with gradient boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM) and ensemble techniques
2. **Feature Enhancement**: Incorporate additional behavioral patterns, weather data, traffic conditions, or temporal features
3. **Threshold Optimization**: Implement cost-sensitive learning and optimal threshold selection for collision prevention
4. **Class Imbalance Solutions**: Explore SMOTE, ADASYN, or advanced sampling techniques beyond class weighting

### Strategic Considerations
1. **Data Augmentation**: Investigate external data sources (traffic patterns, weather, road conditions)
2. **Temporal Modeling**: Consider sequence models or time-series approaches to capture driving pattern evolution
3. **Model Ensemble**: Develop sophisticated ensemble methods combining multiple algorithms
4. **Business Metric Alignment**: Define collision prevention success metrics aligned with business objectives

## Artifacts Generated
- **Model Files**: Trained Random Forest model with preprocessing pipelines
- **Evaluation Plots**: Confusion matrix, PR curves, calibration plots, feature importance
- **MLflow Model**: Registered model for deployment and versioning
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple classification metrics

## Conclusion

This baseline experiment successfully established a collision prediction framework with moderate performance. While the 0.383 macro PR-AUC provides a foundation, significant improvements are needed for practical deployment in safety-critical applications. The comprehensive evaluation framework and feature engineering pipeline create a solid foundation for iterative improvement in subsequent experiments.
