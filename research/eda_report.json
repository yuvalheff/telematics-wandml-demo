Key challenges include severe class imbalance (95.2% no collisions), significant missing values in phone use data (13.4%), and strong multicollinearity among driving exposure metrics. The strongest predictive signal comes from trip frequency (count_trip, r=0.246), showing clear progression across collision classes. Most features are heavily right-skewed with substantial outliers, requiring robust preprocessing. The high driver ID cardinality with minimal repetition indicates cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data. Successful modeling will require careful handling of class imbalance, feature selection to address multicollinearity, appropriate missing value imputation, and scaling/transformation of skewed features. The clear relationship between driving activity levels and collision risk suggests good potential for predictive modeling despite the challenges.",
